A side project I was working while working on my game. I found Inverse Kinematics super interesting and I heard there's a lot of math behind IK so I decided to try it out and see how hard it was. Tbh, since I'm not that good at programming I found it harder to recreate it in pygame than learn the math required for it. It's not completed and I'm gonna try my best to come up with the IK code on my own. I only needed help with the Vector part of it.
